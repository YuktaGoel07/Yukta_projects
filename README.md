#  GUI-Based Keystream Generation for Cryptanalysis and Encryption-Decryption using Stream Ciphers

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
This project is developed under the guidance of DRDO and focuses on building a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for generating keystreams and performing encryption-decryption using stream ciphers. It also aids in basic cryptanalysis for educational and security evaluation purposes.

##  Objectives
- To design a user-friendly GUI for keystream generation.
- To implement stream cipher algorithms for secure communication.
- To demonstrate real-time encryption and decryption.
- To assist in basic cryptanalysis for understanding cipher vulnerabilities.

##  Features
-  Keystream generator (based on Linear Feedback Shift Registers - LFSRs or custom logic)
-  Stream cipher-based encryption and decryption module
-  Cryptanalysis support for studying weak keystream patterns
-  GUI interface for user interaction (built using Tkinter)
-  Save and load encrypted/decrypted files

##  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **GUI**: Tkinter
- **Encryption Logic**: Custom stream cipher implementation
- **Others**: NumPy (if used for bit manipulation), matplotlib (optional for graphs)



## ðŸ§  My Contribution
- Developed core Python modules for stream cipher implementation.
- Designed and implemented the GUI using Tkinter.
- Integrated keystream logic with encryption and decryption features.
- Tested functionality with sample inputs and ensured correctness.
- Documented the entire workflow and created sample usage scenarios.

 # Organization
**Project conducted under:**  
- **Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)**  
  

##  Sample Use Case
1. User enters plaintext in the GUI.
2. Selects encryption mode using a stream cipher.
3. Keystream is generated and shown.
4. Encrypted output is displayed/saved.
5. Optionally, cryptanalysis is performed on cipher text.



##  Future Enhancements
- Add support for more stream ciphers (e.g., RC4, A5/1)
- Visual graphs to analyze keystream randomness
- Option to import/export cipher keys
- Integration with real-time messaging for secure chat
